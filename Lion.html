<p class="description">
  Gorillas are the largest primates and are known for their incredible strength, 
  intelligence, and complex social structures. Native to the forests of central Africa, 
  they live in close-knit family groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback. Gorillas primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and stems, using their strong hands to gather food. Despite their intimidating appearance, they are generally gentle and exhibit deep emotional connections within their groups. These highly intelligent animals communicate through vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions. Unfortunately, habitat loss, poaching, and disease threaten gorilla populations, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival in the wild.
